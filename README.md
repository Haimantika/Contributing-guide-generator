# Contributing-guide-generator

## What is it?
GuideMaster is a contributing guide generator app, that can help you write the Contributing Guide for your open-source projects.

## Technologies used
- HTML
- TailwindCSS
- JavaScript
- OpenAI API

## Contributing to the project
- Make sure to fork the repository first and following the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/Haimantika/Contributing-guide-generator/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- To run the file locally, you can install `Live Server` extension on your code editor (for e.g VS code) and run the HTML file.

## Demo
You can find the live demo [here](https://x.com/HaimantikaM/status/1747638951094141202?s=20).

## Note
- The project is hosted here - https://guidemaster.xyz/ , but you might get the following error: `Error generating text` as we have disabled the API.

## Coming soon:
A blog on how I built it with just HTML,TailwindCSS and a little JavaScript.
